                        Hotspots identified in the above mentioned panels were identified using professional Zenmuse
                        HT20
                        sensors and are only an indication of possible defects that might arise due to various reasons
                        namely
                        manufacturing inaccuracies, improper maintenance & cleaning, etc. These images indicate a
                        difference
                        in temperature when observed using a professional grade thermal camera/sensor and give the asset
                        owner/plant manager/O&M contractor additional information on corrective maintenance. All the
                        defects identified follow IEC Standards 62446-3 and have been classified based on methods &
                        procedures outlined in them. Corrective actions that have been recommended are only indicative
                        of
                        preliminary failures and the estimated loss of power due to the defects has been arrived
                        assuming that
                        complete failure of the components have already occurred. It should be noted that such estimated
                        losses are also dependent on much larger macro factors and only if sufficient information is
                        provided a
                        nearly exact power loss can be computed. Prolonged inaction on the panels might lead to further
                        damage and may result in more critical failure which might be beyond repair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We recommend you to conduct a performance analysis of the asset under maintenance to enhance
                        production & efficiency of the plant.
